# CS220 AU portfolio
## Overview 
This portfolio contains four different components for my CS220 assignment. The first component is my website and what I envision it to be. The second component of my portfolio is a reflective essay where I analyse my engagement with the Web using White et al.'s (2013) model of digital identities. I will also touch on a self and peer assessment that examines the overall success of developing my portfolio. The last component of my portfolio is this outline, a comprehensive explanation of my entire portfolio.

To begin with, as stated above, my website is the first component of the portfolio. Early 2021 (March), I have created a website that turned into my blog, Fierce Muse. Initially, I wanted my blog to be a space to share personal experiences and inspire others. The themes of my blog at the time were self-improvement, spirituality, and mental health. After posting a few blog articles, I have not focused and invested much time into this blog and stopped attempting to create and develop Fierce Muse. I wanted to revisit this project and transform it entirely for this assignment. Since early 2021, my vision for Fierce Muse has changed for almost a year, and I wanted to transform it into something completely different. I want my blog to be less about my personal experiences and more about helping others with their self-improvement goals and journeys. Therefore, I have removed any references to personal experiences from my website. Instead, I have posted blog articles that intend to help and guide others to learn more about themselves and grow by improving themselves, as the overall theme of my website is now self-improvement. To create my website, I have used WIX, a web content management system, and I decided to use this software as part of the assignment because initially, my website was created using this software. Therefore it meant that I was already familiar with its functions and features.

The second component of my portfolio is my reflective essay, which explains the development of my digital identity. It explores how digital identity is measured based on concepts established by White et al. It also analyses my engagement with the Web and how I would like this to change in the future.
The third component of my portfolio is a peer assessment and self-assessment. My entire portfolio has been peer-assessed by 2103461, who has examined my portfolio's first and second components and provided feedback to improve my work ahead of the assignment deadline.

Lastly, as stated above, the fourth component of my portfolio is this overview, where I explain the development of my portfolio and present a detailed to-do list for both my website and essay. The to-do list and log are complimented by the above descriptions of each portfolio component in-depth, providing a clear outline.
