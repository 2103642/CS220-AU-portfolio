# CS220 AU portfolio
## Overview 
This portfolio contains 4 different components for my CS220 assignment. The first component being my website and what I envision it to be. The second component of my portfolio is a reflective essay where I analyse my engagement with the Web using White et al.'s (2013) model of digital identities. I will also touch on a self and peer assessment that examines the overall success of developing my portfolio. The last component of my portfolio is this outline, an overall explanation of my entire portfolio. 

To begin with, as stated above, my website is my first component of the portfolio. Early 2021 (March), I have created a website which turned into my blog, Fierce Muse. Initially, I wanted my blog to be a space where I could share personal experiences and inspire others. The themes of my blog at the time were self-improvement, spirituality, and mental health. After posting a few blog articles, I haven’t focused and invested much of my time into this blog and stopped attempting to create and develop Fierce Muse. I wanted to revisit this project and transform it entirely for this assignment. Since early 2021, over a period of almost a year, my vision for Fierce Muse has changed, and I wanted to transform it into something completely different. I want my blog to be less about my personal experiences and more about helping others with their self-improvement goals and journeys. Therefore, I have removed any references to personal experiences from my website, and instead, I have posted blog articles that intend to help and guide others to learn more about themselves and grow by improving themselves, as the overall theme of my website is now self-improvement. To create my website, I have used WIX, a web content management system, and I decided to use this software as part of the assignment because initially, my website was created using this software, and therefore it meant that I was already familiar with its functions and features. 

The second component of my portfolio is my reflective essay, which explains the development of my digital identity. It explores how digital identity is measured based on concepts established by White et al., and it also analyses my engagement with the Web and how I would like this to change in the future.

The third component of my portfolio is a peer assessment and self-assessment. My entire portfolio has been peer assessed by 2103461, who has examined the first and second component of my portfolio and had provided feedback fo rme to improve my work ahead of the assignment deadline.

lastly, as stated abvove, the fourth component of my portfolio is this overwiew, where i expalin the development of my portfolio and present a detailed to-do list for both my website and essay. The to-do list and log are complimented by the above descriptions of each component of the portfolio in-depth, providing a clear outline.
